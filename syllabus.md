## Programming Languages: Theory and Practice
(*CIS 352* at Syracuse U)

## Grading

CIS352 employs a *specification-based grading* methodology. There are
three categories of assignments:

- Participation Credit
  - Lots of participation points scattered throughout the term.
  - Required quiz (on Blackboard) before each class gives 1 point (for correct answers).
  - Volunteering to livecode in class gives 1 point.
  - "Introduce yourself" to class (1 minute answer to question) gives 1 point.
  - "Meet your professor" to discuss career goals gives 1 point.
  - Groups that present answers to in-class questions will receive 1 point.
- 6 programming projects
  - Projects are assigned throughout the term. All projects are due at
    11:59PM the last day of classes at SU (Friday, May 14, 2021 at
    11:59PM US Eastern Time).
  - 1 participation point will be awarded to all students who have &gt;50% test completion within 10 days of project handout.
  - Projects will be graded via the autograder.
  - Projects will receive one of three distinct grades (based on
    automated tests):
    - Minimally-satisfactory &mdash; Projects which pass a minimal
      number of tests but do not pass enough to reach satisfactory.
    - Satisfactory &mdash; Projects which successfully pass all
      required tests.
    - Excellent &mdash; Projects which successfully pass additional
      tests or add extra / challenging features.
    - Each project handout will include a specification for what is
      required to achieve each of these grades.
- 13 exam questions
  - There are three 60-minute quizzes and one 120-minute exam.
  - *All* quizzes / exams will be cumulative.
  - Exam questions will all be derived from the [written learning
    objectives]({{ "/learning-objectives" | absolute_url }}) for
    CIS352.
  - Questions will be scored as:
    - Satisfactory &mdash; all required components of the answer are
      included. Maybe one or two small mistakes, but answer is correct
      at a high level.
    - Excellent &mdash; answer is completely correct and (possibly)
      includes answering challenging components from more advanced
      parts of the material.
  - If you miss a question on a quiz, you may answer it again on a
    subsequent quiz / the final.
  - However, you may only submit up to *six answers per quiz/exam*.
  - For example, say you are going into the final and have correctly
    answered 10 of the 13 learning objectives.

**Note**: parts of this syllabus are subject to change with adequate
notice to students.

An introduction to the design and implementation of programming
languages, including lab experience using different kinds of languages
and experience implementing programming language features.

**Workload**:
  - 3 lecture hours per week
  - 8 projects (each worth 7%)
  - 2 in-class coding exams (each worth 5%)
  - 1 midterm exam (worth 12%)
  - 1 final exam (worth 20%)
  - This will be a project intensive class. Approximately 6-10
    hours per week *outside* of class will be expected from
    students. I recommend against taking this course concurrent with
    other project-heavy courses.

## Course Overview

This course will introduce many of the principles of programming
language design and implementation. We will discuss numerous features
of several programming languages and the algorithms and data
structures that are needed to provide these features. Projects will
cover both the use of various features and high-level understanding
the algorithms and data structures involved in their
implementation.

Lectures and labs will include examples (and exercises) in Racket. No
prior knowledge of Racket is needed for this course, but students
should be familiar with the programming techniques from their
lower-level courses and possess fluency in basic functional
programming.

## Grading

- Projects: 56%
- Exams: 44%
  - Midterm: 14%
  - Final: 20%
  - Coding Exam 0: 5%
  - Coding Exam 1: 5%

## Grade cutoffs

These are rough grade cutoffs. I never fit grade distributions to a
normal curve (e.g., specifying that only 10% of students may earn an
A), however I may choose to lower the bar for some letter grades. I
will not curve assignments or projects.

- 93% -- A
- 89% -- A-
- 84% -- B+
- 80% -- B
- 77% -- B-
- 74% -- C+
- 70% -- C
- 65% -- C-
- 55% -- D
- 0%  -- F


## Autograder

Projects in this course will be graded by an automatic grader. We may
adjust projects so that portions of the projects include style-based
grading, though we will *not* employ subjective grading. More
pointedly: we will *not* award partial credit for solutions that have
the right ideas but do not pass our tests.

## Late Projects and Extensions

I used to extend project deadlines, but I have found that this is
often unfair to the students who start on time (and more students than
I would have thought have raised this point to me
privately). Therefore, project extensions will be rare--and only in
the event of things such as university closures. Project extensions
for students will not be granted except for religious observances and
extenuating circumstances (family illness, etc..). The late policy is
as follows:

- Projects turned in on time will earn a maximum of 100%

- Projects turned in up to 72 hours late will have a 15% penalty
  applied.

- Projects turned in after 72 hours late (until the end of the term)
  will have a 30% penalty applied.

- Your project grade always be the maximum possible. For example,
  let's say you make an on-time project submission for 60%, but the
  next day you turn in a project which earns an 75%. This submission
  would earn a 63.75%. Five days after the deadline you turn in a
  project earning 100%. Your final score is 70%, as the 70% (100% with
  a 30% penalty) still got the maximum grade of any submission.

You *should* be able to earn **at least** a 70% on all of the projects
with enough work.

## Topics

We will plan to cover all of the following, though some may be dropped
for time:

- Programming in Racket
- Higher-order functions
- Execution models and their impact on the stack
- Pattern matching
- Immutable data structures
- Okasaki-style immutable queues
- Immutable binary trees
- Quad-trees
- Static scope
- Dynamic scope
- Lambda calculus
- Textual-reduction semantics
- Big-step semantics (CE-style evaluators)
- Metacircular interpreters
- Church encoding
- Control and continuations
- Abstract machines
- The CEK machine
- A-Normal Form
- Continuation-passing style
- Top-down parsing
- State-passing style
- Simply-typed lambda calculus
- Type inference
- Hygienic macros
- Logic programming
- MiniKanren

## Projects and Labs

This course will have eight individual projects. Each of these will be
completed using the course's autograder. Lab attendance is encouraged,
but not required. Labs will introduce projects, provide extra help,
give exercises, etc...

## Collaboration and the Honor Code

- Assignments and exams must be done alone

- Specifically, you must never send your code to anyone or allow
  anyone to watch you code.

- The autograder employs elaborate cheat-detection techniques. These
  techniques will compare your code to other students'
  submissions. The TAs will be using these features to periodically
  scan for students who are cheating.

- All apparent cases of academic dishonesty will be reported, even if
  the student believes they made an honest mistake.

- You should feel free to discuss "ideas" about the solution with
  peers, but you should basically never be getting help from peers
  about your code. If you do, it should only be in the abstract (e.g.,
  "can you use operator overloading to implement that?" or "do you
  think it would be sensible to implement this with `map`?") and not
  particularized to your codebase.

- Cite all help other than the professor, T.A., and
  required/recommended text (you are allowed to cite those if you
  wish, but it is not required unless you are specifically told
  otherwise); note that proper citation is sufficient to avoid any
  charge of academic dishonesty, and we will not be particularly
  focused on copyright law during lab work.

- It is fine to get help away from the computer, as long as you erase
  all notes and return to your computer with only the new
  understanding in your head.

**Again**: You should **never** share code with another student. This
  includes both sending a file to another student and "over the
  shoulder" copying (even when, e.g., variable names are changed,
  etc..). In the eyes of the instructor, these are both equally
  bad. You should never be sitting and helping another along by
  writing their code. By doing so you are both violating the honor
  policy and disadvanting the student you are helping (as they may not
  then properly learn the material).

## Student Support

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) in this process.

If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register
with ODS, please visit their website at
http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.

ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic
accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access
plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon
as possible to begin this process.

## Accreditation

As part of the regular ABET accreditation process for the
undergraduate program in computer science, we may be collecting
samples of students' work in each of our undergraduate classes.  As a
result, some of your labs/homeworks/exams may be photocopied/scanned
to be presented for accreditation at some later point.

## Discrimination and Harassment

The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or
discrimination related to any protected category including creed,
ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex,
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color,
veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation,
domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender
expression or perceived gender.

Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these
protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the
Universitys Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. She is
responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws
including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and
Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse,
NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone:
315-443-0211.

If you notice any incidents of harassment or discrimination, however
minor, please email me. You may wish to use an anonymous email service
such as https://anonymousemail.me/. Please feel free to tell me as
much as you feel comfortable.  I am a mandatory Title IX reporter and
must report incidents such as sexual harassment, relationship
violence, stalking, etc...

## Slack

Slack is an instant messaging app for teams. We'll be using it,
hopefully a lot. This is the best place to get in touch with me for
one-off questions, ask for an appointment for office hours,
etc..

Email me if you have not been invited to the course Slack.
