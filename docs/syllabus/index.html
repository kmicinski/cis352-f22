<p>(<em>CIS 352</em> at Syracuse U)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: parts of this syllabus are subject to change with adequate
notice to students.</p>

<p>An introduction to the design and implementation of programming
languages, including lab experience using different kinds of languages
and experience implementing programming language features.</p>

<p><strong>Workload</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asynchronous video lecture units (at most ~80min per week)</li>
  <li>Participation points:
    <ul>
      <li>Quiz before each lecture (closes as lecture begins)</li>
      <li>See other sources of participation below</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>6 projects</li>
  <li>3 quizzes and a final, all cumulative (see grading note).</li>
  <li>This will be a project intensive class. Approximately 6-10
hours per week <em>outside</em> of class will be expected from
students. I recommend against taking this course concurrent with
other project-heavy courses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>CIS352 employs a <em>specification-based grading</em> methodology. There are
three categories of assignments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participation Credit
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of participation points scattered throughout the term.</li>
      <li>Required quiz (on Blackboard) before each class gives 1 point (for correct answers).</li>
      <li>Volunteering to livecode in class gives 1 point.</li>
      <li>“Introduce yourself” to class (1 minute answer to question) gives 1 point.</li>
      <li>“Meet your professor” to discuss career goals gives 1 point.</li>
      <li>Groups that present answers to in-class questions will receive 1 point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>6 programming projects
    <ul>
      <li>Projects are assigned throughout the term. All projects are due at
11:59PM the last day of classes at SU (Friday, May 14, 2021 at
11:59PM US Eastern Time).</li>
      <li>1 participation point will be awarded to all students who have &gt;50% test completion within 10 days of project handout.</li>
      <li>Projects will be graded via the autograder.</li>
      <li>Projects will receive one of three distinct grades (based on
automated tests):
        <ul>
          <li>Minimally-satisfactory — Projects which pass a minimal
number of tests but do not pass enough to reach satisfactory.</li>
          <li>Satisfactory — Projects which successfully pass all
required tests.</li>
          <li>Excellent — Projects which successfully pass additional
tests or add extra / challenging features.</li>
          <li>Each project handout will include a specification for what is
required to achieve each of these grades.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13 exam questions
    <ul>
      <li>There are three 60-minute quizzes and one 120-minute exam.</li>
      <li><em>All</em> quizzes / exams will be cumulative.</li>
      <li>Exam questions will all be derived from the <a href="http://localhost:4000/learning-objectives">written learning
objectives</a> for
CIS352.</li>
      <li>Questions will be scored as:
        <ul>
          <li>Satisfactory — all required components of the answer are
included. Maybe one or two small mistakes, but answer is correct
at a high level.</li>
          <li>Excellent — answer is completely correct and (possibly)
includes answering challenging components from more advanced
parts of the material.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you miss a question on a quiz, you may answer it again on a
subsequent quiz / the final.</li>
      <li>However, you may only submit up to <em>six answers per quiz/exam</em>.</li>
      <li>For example, say you are going into the final and have correctly
answered 10 of the 13 learning objectives.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<!-- ## Course Overview -->

<!-- This course will introduce many of the principles of programming -->
<!-- language design and implementation. We will discuss numerous features -->
<!-- of several programming languages and the algorithms and data -->
<!-- structures that are needed to provide these features. Projects will -->
<!-- cover both the use of various features and high-level understanding -->
<!-- the algorithms and data structures involved in their -->
<!-- implementation. -->

<!-- Lectures and labs will include examples (and exercises) in Racket. No -->
<!-- prior knowledge of Racket is needed for this course, but students -->
<!-- should be familiar with the programming techniques from their -->
<!-- lower-level courses and possess fluency in basic functional -->
<!-- programming. -->

<!-- ## Grading -->

<!-- - Projects: 56% -->
<!-- - Exams: 44% -->
<!--   - Midterm: 14% -->
<!--   - Final: 20% -->
<!--   - Coding Exam 0: 5% -->
<!--   - Coding Exam 1: 5% -->

<!-- ## Grade cutoffs -->

<!-- These are rough grade cutoffs. I never fit grade distributions to a -->
<!-- normal curve (e.g., specifying that only 10% of students may earn an -->
<!-- A), however I may choose to lower the bar for some letter grades. I -->
<!-- will not curve assignments or projects. -->

<!-- - 93% -- A -->
<!-- - 89% -- A- -->
<!-- - 84% -- B+ -->
<!-- - 80% -- B -->
<!-- - 77% -- B- -->
<!-- - 74% -- C+ -->
<!-- - 70% -- C -->
<!-- - 65% -- C- -->
<!-- - 55% -- D -->
<!-- - 0%  -- F -->

<!-- ## Autograder -->

<!-- Projects in this course will be graded by an automatic grader. We may -->
<!-- adjust projects so that portions of the projects include style-based -->
<!-- grading, though we will *not* employ subjective grading. More -->
<!-- pointedly: we will *not* award partial credit for solutions that have -->
<!-- the right ideas but do not pass our tests. -->

<!-- ## Late Projects and Extensions -->

<!-- I used to extend project deadlines, but I have found that this is -->
<!-- often unfair to the students who start on time (and more students than -->
<!-- I would have thought have raised this point to me -->
<!-- privately). Therefore, project extensions will be rare--and only in -->
<!-- the event of things such as university closures. Project extensions -->
<!-- for students will not be granted except for religious observances and -->
<!-- extenuating circumstances (family illness, etc..). The late policy is -->
<!-- as follows: -->

<!-- - Projects turned in on time will earn a maximum of 100% -->

<!-- - Projects turned in up to 72 hours late will have a 15% penalty -->
<!--   applied. -->

<!-- - Projects turned in after 72 hours late (until the end of the term) -->
<!--   will have a 30% penalty applied. -->

<!-- - Your project grade always be the maximum possible. For example, -->
<!--   let's say you make an on-time project submission for 60%, but the -->
<!--   next day you turn in a project which earns an 75%. This submission -->
<!--   would earn a 63.75%. Five days after the deadline you turn in a -->
<!--   project earning 100%. Your final score is 70%, as the 70% (100% with -->
<!--   a 30% penalty) still got the maximum grade of any submission. -->

<!-- You *should* be able to earn **at least** a 70% on all of the projects -->
<!-- with enough work. -->

<!-- ## Topics -->

<!-- We will plan to cover all of the following, though some may be dropped -->
<!-- for time: -->

<!-- - Programming in Racket -->
<!-- - Higher-order functions -->
<!-- - Execution models and their impact on the stack -->
<!-- - Pattern matching -->
<!-- - Immutable data structures -->
<!-- - Okasaki-style immutable queues -->
<!-- - Immutable binary trees -->
<!-- - Quad-trees -->
<!-- - Static scope -->
<!-- - Dynamic scope -->
<!-- - Lambda calculus -->
<!-- - Textual-reduction semantics -->
<!-- - Big-step semantics (CE-style evaluators) -->
<!-- - Metacircular interpreters -->
<!-- - Church encoding -->
<!-- - Control and continuations -->
<!-- - Abstract machines -->
<!-- - The CEK machine -->
<!-- - A-Normal Form -->
<!-- - Continuation-passing style -->
<!-- - Top-down parsing -->
<!-- - State-passing style -->
<!-- - Simply-typed lambda calculus -->
<!-- - Type inference -->
<!-- - Hygienic macros -->
<!-- - Logic programming -->
<!-- - MiniKanren -->

<!-- ## Projects and Labs -->

<!-- This course will have eight individual projects. Each of these will be -->
<!-- completed using the course's autograder. Lab attendance is encouraged, -->
<!-- but not required. Labs will introduce projects, provide extra help, -->
<!-- give exercises, etc... -->

<!-- ## Collaboration and the Honor Code -->

<!-- - Assignments and exams must be done alone -->

<!-- - Specifically, you must never send your code to anyone or allow -->
<!--   anyone to watch you code. -->

<!-- - The autograder employs elaborate cheat-detection techniques. These -->
<!--   techniques will compare your code to other students' -->
<!--   submissions. The TAs will be using these features to periodically -->
<!--   scan for students who are cheating. -->

<!-- - All apparent cases of academic dishonesty will be reported, even if -->
<!--   the student believes they made an honest mistake. -->

<!-- - You should feel free to discuss "ideas" about the solution with -->
<!--   peers, but you should basically never be getting help from peers -->
<!--   about your code. If you do, it should only be in the abstract (e.g., -->
<!--   "can you use operator overloading to implement that?" or "do you -->
<!--   think it would be sensible to implement this with `map`?") and not -->
<!--   particularized to your codebase. -->

<!-- - Cite all help other than the professor, T.A., and -->
<!--   required/recommended text (you are allowed to cite those if you -->
<!--   wish, but it is not required unless you are specifically told -->
<!--   otherwise); note that proper citation is sufficient to avoid any -->
<!--   charge of academic dishonesty, and we will not be particularly -->
<!--   focused on copyright law during lab work. -->

<!-- - It is fine to get help away from the computer, as long as you erase -->
<!--   all notes and return to your computer with only the new -->
<!--   understanding in your head. -->

<!-- **Again**: You should **never** share code with another student. This -->
<!--   includes both sending a file to another student and "over the -->
<!--   shoulder" copying (even when, e.g., variable names are changed, -->
<!--   etc..). In the eyes of the instructor, these are both equally -->
<!--   bad. You should never be sitting and helping another along by -->
<!--   writing their code. By doing so you are both violating the honor -->
<!--   policy and disadvanting the student you are helping (as they may not -->
<!--   then properly learn the material). -->

<!-- ## Student Support -->

<!-- Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed -->
<!-- to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be -->
<!-- aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in -->
<!-- barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I -->
<!-- invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or -->
<!-- accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your -->
<!-- success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services -->
<!-- (ODS) in this process. -->

<!-- If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register -->
<!-- with ODS, please visit their website at -->
<!-- http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email -->
<!-- disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information. -->

<!-- ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic -->
<!-- accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access -->
<!-- plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and -->
<!-- generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon -->
<!-- as possible to begin this process. -->

<!-- ## Accreditation -->

<!-- As part of the regular ABET accreditation process for the -->
<!-- undergraduate program in computer science, we may be collecting -->
<!-- samples of students' work in each of our undergraduate classes.  As a -->
<!-- result, some of your labs/homeworks/exams may be photocopied/scanned -->
<!-- to be presented for accreditation at some later point. -->

<!-- ## Discrimination and Harassment -->

<!-- The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or -->
<!-- discrimination related to any protected category including creed, -->
<!-- ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, -->
<!-- gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, -->
<!-- veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, -->
<!-- domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender -->
<!-- expression or perceived gender. -->

<!-- Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these -->
<!-- protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the -->
<!-- Universitys Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. She is -->
<!-- responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws -->
<!-- including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation -->
<!-- Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and -->
<!-- Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, -->
<!-- NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone: -->
<!-- 315-443-0211. -->

<!-- If you notice any incidents of harassment or discrimination, however -->
<!-- minor, please email me. You may wish to use an anonymous email service -->
<!-- such as https://anonymousemail.me/. Please feel free to tell me as -->
<!-- much as you feel comfortable.  I am a mandatory Title IX reporter and -->
<!-- must report incidents such as sexual harassment, relationship -->
<!-- violence, stalking, etc... -->

<!-- ## Slack -->

<!-- Slack is an instant messaging app for teams. We'll be using it, -->
<!-- hopefully a lot. This is the best place to get in touch with me for -->
<!-- one-off questions, ask for an appointment for office hours, -->
<!-- etc.. -->

<!-- Email me if you have not been invited to the course Slack. -->
